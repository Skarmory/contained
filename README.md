# contained
Common data structures and some algorithms implemented from scratch in C.

Most being done for learning/reinforcement purposes rather than actual use.
Will eventually make its way into my other C side projects though.

I will be attempting to cover all the containers that could be found in the C++ standard library.
As well, I will be implementing well known sorting algorithms.
Also has a very minimalistic header-only testing "suite". Maybe that can spin off into it own thing someday.

Obviously they won't be as good though.

# Wot we got
As of latest update we have:

## Data structures
* Static array wrapper (like C++ std::array)
* Dynamic array (like C++ std::vector)

## Algorithms
* Iterative quicksort

## In progress
* Red black trees

# Usage
Just grab it and off you go. Same as any other C source.
